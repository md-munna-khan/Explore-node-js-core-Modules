In this module, you’ll start by understanding the event-driven heart of Node.js and explore how it handles tasks synchronously and asynchronously, especially when it comes to reading files, working with buffers, and streaming data efficiently.



But that’s just the beginning…

By the end of this module, you’ll be:

Building your own logger app to track events and activities
Navigating the filesystem using the Path module
Creating a basic ToDo app using Node’s native HTTP server
Implementing routing, setting custom response headers, and using Postman to test your API
Handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on ToDos with real HTTP requests—query params and all!


This module bridges the gap between learning and doing. It's where you transform knowledge into projects, gain confidence in Node.js fundamentals, and start thinking like a real backend developer.



Let’s go—your first full Node-powered app is just a few lessons away!
